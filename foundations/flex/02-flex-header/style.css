/* 
(Bring up the index.html side by side)

Notice that the header div has flex display. 

Hence, the left link and right links div, as well as the logo are
directly affected by it. 

Since divs take the size of their content, div fits
exactly around the uls (so the uls themselves are center-aligned.)

We set ul itself to be flex too, such that each li
is directly affected by it.
